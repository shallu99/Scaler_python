'''q7
You are given 3 integer angles(in degrees) A, B and C of a triangle. You have to tell whether the triangle is valid or not.


A triangle is valid if sum of its angles equals to 180.

NOTE: You have to take the input of 3 sides of triangle from the user.


Problem Constraints

1 <= A, B, C <= 180



Input Format

First line of the input contains an integer A.


Second line of the input contains an integer B.

Third line of the input contains an integer C.




Output Format

Print 1 if the triangle having given sides is valid, else print 0.



Example Input

Input 1:



 60
 60
 60
Input 2:

 30
 40
 50




Example Output

Output 1:



 1 
Output 2:

 0 




Example Explanation

Explanation 1:



 Sum of angles = A + B + C = 60 + 60 + 60 = 180
 Hence, the given triangle is valid.
Explanation 2:

 Sum of angles = A + B + C = 30 + 40 + 50 = 120
 As sum of angles is not equal to 180, the given triangle is not valid.

'''q9
You are given the Cost Price C and Selling Price S of a Product. You have to tell whether there is a Profit or Loss. Also, calculate total profit or loss.

NOTE: It is guaranteed that Cost Price and Selling Price are not equal.

NOTE: You have to take input of the Cost Price(C) and Selling Price(S) from the user.



Problem Constraints

1 <= C, S <= 109

C â‰  S





Input Format

First line of the input contains a single integer C.



Second line of the input contains a single integer S.





Output Format

Print two integers in separate lines.



First integer denotes whether there is a profit or loss. If there is a profit, print 1, else print -1.

Second integer is a non-negative integer denoting the absolute value of total profit or loss.





Example Input

Input 1:



 2
 4
Input 2:

 4
 1




Example Output

Output 1:



 1
 2
Output 2:

 -1
 3




Example Explanation

Explanation 1:



 Cost Price = 2
 Selling Price = 4
 As Cost Price < Selling Price, there is a profit.
 Total Profit = Selling Price - Cost Price = 4 - 2 = 2
Explanation 2:

 Cost Price = 4
 Selling Price = 1
 As Cost Price > Selling Price, there is a loss.
 Total Loss = Cost Price - Selling Price = 4 - 1 = 3

'''q10
Write a program to input from user an integer(n) representing the rating of a person on a platform.

You have to print the category of that person.

If the rating is greater than or equal to 2100 then that person is "grand master".
If the rating is greater than or equal to 1900 then that person is "candidate master".
If the rating is greater than or equal to 1600 then that person is "expert".
If the rating is greater than or equal to 1400 then that person is "pupil".
If the rating is smaller than 1400 then that person is "newbie".
