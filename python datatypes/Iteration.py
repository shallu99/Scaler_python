'''q8
You are given an integer A as input and you need to determine whether it is a palindrome or not.
A palindrome integer is one whose digits, when reversed, result in the same number.
For example, 121 is a palindrome because its reverse is also 121, but 123 is not a palindrome because its reverse is 321.

Note: The given integer will not have any leading zeros.

Problem Constraints
1 <= A <= 106

Input Format
First and the only line contains a single integer A.

Output Format
Print Yes if it is palindromic, else print No.

Input 2:
 1001 
Input 3:
 131 

Example Output
Output 1:
 No

 Yes 

Example Explanation
Explanation 1:
 For A = 120, reverse(A) = reverse(120) = 021 = 21 (removing leading zeroes). 120 is not equal to 21 
Explanation 2:

 For A = 1001, reverse(A) = reverse(1001) = 1001, which is same as A.

'''a10
You have been provided with a bank account that has an initial balance of N amount. You are now required to perform two operations on this account, namely, ADD and SUBTRACT.

ADD operation: This operation increases the account balance by a certain amount and you are expected to print the updated balance after each ADD operation.
SUBTRACT operation: This operation decreases the account balance by a certain amount and you are again expected to print the updated balance after each SUBTRACT operation.
However, if the amount you are trying to subtract (i.e., debit) from the account balance is greater than the current balance, you should print "Insufficient Funds" (without quotes) instead of the updated balance. In this case, the operation should be skipped, and the account balance should remain unchanged.


Note :
Initial Amount N and Amount that is given are larger numbers.
Problem Constraints

1 <= N, X <= 1011
1 <= Number of operations <= 105

Input Format

The initial balance in the bank account is provided as a single integer N.
The number of operations to be performed on the bank account is provided as a single integer M.
Each of the next M lines contains two space-separated integers Type and Amount(X).
The value of Type can either be 1 or 2. If Type is 1, then the ADD operation needs to be performed, and if Type is 2, 
then the SUBTRACT operation needs to be performed.
The value of Amount(X) represents the amount of money to be added or subtracted from the account.

Output Format

Print Amount in the bank balance after each operation on a new line.

Example Input

1000
3
1 500
2 1400
2 500

Example Output

1500
100
Insufficient Funds

Example Explanation
Initially bank balance is 1000. 
First operation, ADD 500, bank balance becomes 1500, print it.
Second operation, SUBTRACT 1400, bank balance becomes 100, print it.
Third operation, SUBTRACT 500, print "Insufficient Funds".
